CFC Assessment

This is my solution to the asessment from CFC.

I have included the two JSON outputs which is done by running the Python Script but the requirments in the requirements.txt file need to be downloaded first.

Ensure you have Python 3.9 installed.

Then before running the code, run this command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, on VSCode, select the "Run Python File" command present when having the main.py file open under the run button.
